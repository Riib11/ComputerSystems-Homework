## 1.

a) For 2^8 objects, it takes about 10,000 iteration to get a mean stable to the second decimal, and for 2^24 objects it takes about 20 iterations to get a mean stable to the second decimal. So, it seems reasonable that a sort of exponential (base-2) interpolation between these two extremes would yield good results for the mean time values for between 2^8 and 2^24 objects. I verified this method experimentally.

b) Since the program automatically takes the mean of `iters` number of trials, I can just use the resulting number by choosing the judge an entry by its mean time for a number of objects.

c) (in all_data.png)
